## Abstract
Synthetic cardiac MRI (CMRI) generation has emerged as a promising strategy to overcome the scarcity of annotated medical imaging data. Recent advances in GANs, VAEs, diffusion probabilistic models, and flow-matching techniques aim to generate anatomically accurate images while addressing challenges such as limited labeled datasets, vendor variability, and risks of privacy leakage through model memorization. Mask-conditioned generation improves structural fidelity by guiding synthesis with segmentation maps, while diffusion and flow-matching models offer strong boundary preservation and efficient deterministic transformations. Cross-domain generalization is further supported through vendor-style conditioning and preprocessing steps like intensity normalization. To ensure privacy, studies increasingly incorporate membership inference attacks, nearest-neighbor analyses, and differential privacy mechanisms. Utility evaluations commonly measure downstream segmentation performance, with evidence showing that anatomically constrained synthetic data can enhance accuracy and robustness across multi-vendor settings. This review aims to compare existing CMRI generation approaches through the lenses of fidelity, utility, and privacy, highlighting current limitations and the need for integrated, evaluation-driven frameworks for reliable clinical workflows.
